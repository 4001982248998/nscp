TODO: 
 * Process times and similar ?
 * Add bind_to_address in the socket
 * Fix configuration GUI (low priority)
 * Fix installer (low priority)
 * Service check to use Auto (filter by started setting etc.)
 * Add module for relaying events
 * Check multitasking problems on the sockets.

 * Add support for rendering results (eventlog etc) [In progress]

2006-02-12 MickeM
 + Added new Interface for Modules (NSCommandLineExec that allows modules to execute things give from command line.
   Syntax is NSClient++ <module name> <command> [arguments] and if a module doesn't support this it is simply ignored.
 + Added new install/uninstall command to SystemTray module:
   NSClient++.exe SystemTray install 
   NSClient++.exe SystemTray uninstall 
   That will install/uninstall the system tray module this sets the "Allow Service to Interact with Desktop" flag for the service.
 * Removed the "Allow Service to Interact with Desktop" flag from the /install option so that it no longer defaults to on (see commands to set this above).
 * Fixed so checkProcess isn't case sensitive.
 * Added (not finished) syntax option to event log checker to format the outputted data

2006-02-12 MickeM
 + Added support for host name resolve to allowed_hosts

2006-02-08 MickeM
 ! Fixed filter-eventID in EventLog module (now works for all IDs regardless of severity state)
 + Added new filters to EventLog (filter-severity that can filter based on event severity success, error, warning, informational)

2006-02-07 MickeM
 + Added new filter option to eventlog filter-eventID
 + Added new operator to all numeric filters in:number,number,... etc. (for instance filter-eventID=in:123,456,789 to check for lists.

2006-02-05 MickeM
 + Added CheckFile check command
   This new command (in development) will allow various file checks such as age, size, date, etc on single or multiple files.
 + Added FILEAGE support to NSClient
 + Started to convert the web page to WIKI
 
2006-01-21 MickeM
 + Added WMI Check module (early alpha)
   This is an extremely early alpha more to see if there is an interest and how to progress with it.
   To use the WMI module enable the WMICheck.dll (nsc.ini) and then run the following check:
   CheckWMI MaxWarn=10 MaxCrit=15 "Query:load=Select LoadPercentage from win32_Processor"
   The Max* are as every other check and sets limits. 
   The Query works similarly to other check commands ie. Query:<name>=<WMI query>
   So any other WMI query should work (notice this is experimental and not stable and has virtually 
   no error handling so it is likely to crash nsclient if you ask anything "non working".)
   I would *really* *really* like to get feedback on how to expand this concept to work better so feel free to come with feedback.
  * Fixed NT4 /install (should work now!)

2006-01-02 MickeM
