Put your "libs" here to make building automatic:
I have the following in my directory:

boost_regex-vc71-mt-p-1_32.dll	- Only needed if you want to compile the CheckEventLog module
msvcp71.dll			- Regular MS VC++ 7.1 runtimes
msvcr71.dll			- Regular MS VC++ 7.1 runtimes
stlport_vc7146.dll		- STL port runtimes
